	<div>1 ) How many <span style="font-weight: bold;">irreplaceable losses</span> have you really had?

	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"Whoever was still alive had reason for hope.</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> Health, family, happiness, professional abilities, fortune, position in society
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> all these were things that could be achieved again or restored."</div>

	</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>2 ) You don't know what the <b>future</b> will bring. 
	</div>
	<div>There are always opportunities for individuals to improve their situation a little on the short term.</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"For no man knew what the future would bring, much less the hour"</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">-- Frankl</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>3 ) The <b>past</b> has had many joys, and that will stay with you forever.
	</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"What you have experienced, no power on earth can take from you."</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">-- poet</div>
	<div style="">
		<br/>
	</div>

	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">-- Frankl</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>4 ) There are always <b>opportunities</b> to give life
		<b>meaning</b>
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>
			<br/>
		</b>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"keep their courage in the certainty that the hopelessness of our struggle did not
		detract from its dignity and its meaning"

	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">-- Frankl</div>
	<div>

	</div>
	<div>

	</div>
	<div>5 ) <b>Sacrifice</b> has meaning in any case
	</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">"I told them of a comrade who on his arrival in camp had tried to make a pact with
		Heaven
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> that his suffering and death should save the human being he loved from a painful
		end.
	</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;"> For this man, suffering and death were meaningful"</div>
	<div style="margin-left: 40px;">-- Frankl</div>
