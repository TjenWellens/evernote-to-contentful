	<div>There are things in your life you can <b>influence</b>. 
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>There are things in your life you can't influence.</div>
	<div>You can see this as a spectrum going from totally in your influence, to not in your influence at all.</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>
		<b>Concern</b>
	</div>
	<div>There are things in your life that <b>concern</b> you. 
	</div>
	<div>There are things in your life you aren't concerned about.</div>
	<div>This is also a spectrum from very much concerned about to totally not concerned about.</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>Imagine all the things you can influence as a <b>circle</b>. 
	</div>
	<div>With the things you can influence very much, near the centre.</div>
	<div>And the things you can influence very little, near the edge.</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>Imagine all the things you might be concerned about as a circle as well.</div>
	<div>Your circle of influence will be smaller than your circle of concern.</div>
	<div>

	</div>

	<div>Circle of

			<font color="#008001">Influence</font>

	</div>
	<div>Circle of

			<b>Concern</b>

	</div>
	<div>Now you can choose where to <b>focus</b> your energy:
	</div>
	<div>If you focus your energy in your circle of influence. </div>
	<div>When you do things you can do. </div>
	<div>Your circle of influence grows. </div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>If you focus your energy in your circle of concern. </div>
	<div>When you worry about things you can't change. </div>
	<div>Your circle of influence shrinks. </div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>Eg.</div>
	<div>When you make a plan on how to make money, your influence grows.</div>
	<div>When you worry about not having money, your influence lessens.</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>

	</div>
	<div>
		<br/>
	</div>
	<div>Why is this model <b>useful</b>?
	</div>
	<div>It makes clear that you are in control of where to focus your energy.</div>
	<div>It shows that worrying about things you have little to no influence about, is useless and maybe even harmful.
